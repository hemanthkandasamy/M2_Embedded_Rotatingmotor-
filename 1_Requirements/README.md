## Introduction
   A Direct Current (DC) motor is a type of Electric machine that converts Electrical energy into Mechanical energy. DC motors take Electrical power through Direct current, and convert this energy into Mechanical rotation. The Output Torque and speed depends upon both the Electrical input and the Design of the Motor.
## Research
DC Motor is one  of the  traditional electric  machines, is  appeared in the late  of 19th century. In compared to the other electric machine. DC Motors are still commonly used in industrial fields such as steel rolling, transportation, construction.
DC motors use magnetic fields that occur from the electrical currents generated, which powers the movement of a rotor fixed within the output shaft. The output torque and speed depends upon both the electrical input and the design of the motor.

Atmega 328
The high-performance Microchip 8-bit AVR® RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP Flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented Two-Wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8-channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and five software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts.

##Defing my Project
It works on the principle of Lorentz Law, which states that “the current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic and electric field experience a force”.
It converts Electrical energy into Mechanical energy.
The direction of this force is given by Fleming's left-hand rule and its magnitude is given by F = BIL. Where, B = magnetic flux density, I = current and L = length of the conductor within the magnetic field. 
## Fleming's left hand rule
If we stretch the first finger, second finger and thumb of our left hand to be perpendicular to each other, and the direction of magnetic field is represented by the first finger, direction of the current is represented by the second finger, then the thumb represents direction of the force experienced by the current carrying conductor.
##Features 
*  Operating speeds of  1000  to  5000  rpm
*  60 - 75 % efficiency rate
*  High staring torque
*  There is Low no-load speed.
## SWOT Analysis
__STRENGTH__
*  High starting torque, No load speed and Quick starting, Stopping, Reversing and Accleration.

__WEAKNESS__
*  It has High initial cost and Cannot operate in explosive and hazard conditions due to sparking

__OPPURTUNITIES__
*  Larger throttle body and injectors. using a stronger magnet and increasing the number of turns of wire in the coil and reducing friction between the coil and the axel it rotates on.

__THREATS__
*  Common causes of winding failure include high temperature. if we mistaked at any wiring configuration, it will create huge problem

## 4W'S and 1'H
WHO -  Can be done by person having knowledge of Embedded detials

WHAT - The main aim of this project is to reduce Working in High Voltage

WHEN - It is Used when we are using an tools, Electric vehicles, household items and industrial purpose and Do programming of microcontroller and perform simulation

WHERE - Used in tools, toy and some Industry and Engineering Colleges Research purpose  by Laptop or personal computer

HOW - The rotation of the DC motor is accomplished by the force which is developed on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. The current-carrying conductor is connected to the shaft which is able to rotate relative to the stationary body of the DC motor
